# Lead_Scoring_Case_Study

X Education, an online course provider, attracts professionals to their website for course exploration. Lead generation occurs through form submissions and referrals. Despite numerous leads, the current conversion rate of 30% is unsatisfactory. To enhance efficiency, a logistic model is needed to assign lead scores (0 to 100) to every lead. Higher scores indicate 'Hot Leads' with better conversion potential. The objective is to achieve an 80% conversion rate by focusing on leads with higher scores. This model aims to optimize lead conversion and boost overall effectiveness.

Roadmap:

Reading and Inspecting Data - Read, load, understand and analyse the data.
Data Cleaning (Dropping Insignificant Columns) - Handling missing values and dropping insignificant variables.
Data Visualization and Exploratory Data Analysis - To gather insights from the data.
Data Pre-processing for Model Building - Creating dummy variables,fFeature scaling and standardization, splitting into train and test sets.
Model Building - Initial feature selection using RFE, and subsequently by Manual Feature Elimination. Selecting the optimal model with p-values and VIFs under acceptable limits, as final.
Making Predictions and Model Evaluation â€“ Evaluating model metrics, fine tuning the cutoff point, calculating lead score.
